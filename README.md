# Saving Princess Archipelago Basepatch

A set of modifications for Saving Princess that add Archipelago Multiworld compatibility.

## I'm just here to play, what do I need to do?

You can head over to the [setup guide](SETUP.md).

## Wait, where is the source for the patch?

In order to share the source, a lot of the original code and assets would need to be included.
Therefore, this repo instead contains instructions on how to recreate something that's close to the source I have on my machine.

So, here's a guide to get your own [source at home](SOURCE.md).

## What are the checks?

You can get a check for:
- Collecting a chest's item
- Collecting a boss' item
Note that, for the items you can find as either a chest or a boss item (but never both on the same run), they are both the same check.

And if you are playing with the Expanded Pool option, also for:
- Completing the intro sequence
- Defeating a boss
- Powering the generator's orb

## How about the rewards?

As for the rewards, they are everything you would get in the base game:
- Weapons (Powered Blaster, Flamethrower, Ice Spreadshot, Volt Laser)
- Life Extensions
- Clip Extensions
- Faster Reload upgrades
- Special Extension (just one)
- The jacket

While playing with the Expanded Pool, a few new items are added, which are required to reach the end:
- 4 Keys, one for each main area, which open the door to the final area
- System Power, which restores power to the final area

Additionally, there's new items, which work as filler and traps:
- Full Heal (replenishes health and ammo)
- Quick-fire Mode (instant reload for a while)
- Active Camouflage (a bunch of iframes)
- Ice Trap
- Shake Trap
- Ninja Trap

## Where is the APWorld?

That can be found over at [my fork of the main Archipelago repo](https://github.com/LeonarthCG/Archipelago/releases/latest).
